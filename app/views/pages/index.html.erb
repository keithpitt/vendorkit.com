    <h2>What is VendorKit?</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
    <p>VendorKit makes the process of using and managing libraries in iOS easy. VendorKit is modeled after Bundler. VendorKit streamlines the installation and update process for dependent libraries. It also tracks versions and manages dependencies between libraries.</p>
    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
    <p>VendorKit works by making direct modifications to your project file. When you install a library, vendor will copy all the source files, build setting and frameworks
    to your project, then save it. That way, when you want to install a library, all you have to do is add it to your Vendorfile, and then type into your Terminal <code>vendor install</code></p>
    <p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>
    <p>VendorKit (the site and the tool) are both fully open source, released under the MIT licence. If you want to get a copy, head over to: <a href="http://github.com/keithpitt/vendor">github.com/keithpitt/vendor</a> and <a href="http://github.com/keithpitt/vendorkit.com">github.com/keithpitt/vendorkit.com</a></p>
